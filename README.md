# Hi there! I'm Pitch!

## About Me
I'm a software enthusiast based in **Maputo, Mozambique**, passionate about **open source** and **data science**. I'm constantly learning and exploring how to solve problems through code, with a particular interest in low-level programming and understanding how systems work.

Currently diving deeper into **DevOps** and **data engineering**, I'm building projects to learn and practice these concepts while contributing back to the open source community.

## What Drives Me
- **Learning through building**: Each project is an opportunity to understand something new and share what I discover
- **Open source contribution**: Giving back to the community while learning from others' code and feedback
- **System curiosity**: Always asking "how does this work underneath?" and diving into the details
- **Practical problem-solving**: Building tools that solve real problems I encounter in my learning journey

## Featured Projects

### BrokoliSQL(https://github.com/hc12r/brokolisql)
A Python-based command-line tool that converts structured data files (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML) into SQL INSERT statements. Solving the everyday problem of data migration and database population with elegance and efficiency.
- **Tech Stack**: Python
- **Key Features**: Multi-format support, CLI interface, Batch processing
- **Also available in Go**: [brokolisql-go](https://github.com/hc12r/brokolisql-go)

## What I Find Interesting About This Journey

**Cross-Language Learning**: I'm exploring the same problems in different languages (Python â†’ Go with BrokoliSQL) to understand how language choice affects implementation and performance. Each rewrite teaches me something new.

**Building for the AI Era**: Projects like promptweaver are my way of learning how traditional development workflows might evolve. I'm still figuring out the best patterns, but it's exciting to explore.

**End-to-End Understanding**: I'm trying to build projects across the full stack - from data processing to deployment - because I believe understanding the whole picture makes you better at any individual piece.

**Learning in Public**: Every project here represents something I'm learning or have learned. Some work better than others, but they all teach me something valuable.

## Currently Learning
- Advanced Go patterns and concurrency
- Cloud-native architectures and their trade-offs
- Kubernetes and container orchestration
- Real-time data processing pipelines
- AI integration patterns in development workflows

## Let's Connect
